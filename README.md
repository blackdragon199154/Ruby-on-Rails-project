The main goal is to build a website like framesdirect.com try to checkout the following products to see what the differences are:

http://www.framesdirect.com/Acuvue-1-Day-Moist-90-PACK-contact-lenses-cp-ni/k.html


http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Oakley-tcnisg/r.html


http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Shuron-nfpeo/r.html


http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Oakley-tdqgrc/r.html


http://www.framesdirect.com/framesfp/Silhouette_Rimless-tdrbqe/r.html


http://www.framesdirect.com/Adidas-Prescription-Sunglasses-prescsgp/rxsgp-lanaoj-s-l-k-k-lfmjthn.html


** don't forget to check that during checkout of each product you get recommendation of things that can be applied to each lens.



With a robust CMS to be capable of managing large inventories and complex products.

I have also created a few videos that might help you in understudying this project.

Frames, lens, contact lens and sunglasses are all individual products.



**Products:**
Contact Lenses.PDF 
That can be made with default spree functions/attributes.
[Contact Lense.PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tjdtb6a631j4qa8/AAB1fd4XABuySADC_KOFUbQua?dl=0) is the file that shows the process for checkout for this 



[Glasses.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e9stnuwjaoa8zu7/Glasses.pdf?dl=0) shows all possible attributes for glasses (optical glasses.)
That needs to be made with custom programming and you will need to check and follow the information on Optical-Formulas.pdf, and also "HOW it can be done" folder will give you a general idea on how these tools can be made.



You might also need to check on [Inventory Folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vjg1jg83ukwq6bt/AAADjlIMtf4Dmo3xXA_gxYm0a?dl=0) to see how each product is and what are the relations with other products.



[frames.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/05uhokqvfw5c8y9/frames.pdf?dl=0) and [checkout.pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oh1arvp8obnvt6j/Checkout.pdf?dl=0) are showing you how these areas of the site should work.
